/**
 * There were a few good reasons why Kotlin introduces properties. One of them is property access syntax
 * (we use height instead of getHeight/setHeight) which is more concise,
 * another is the fact that getters and setters are closer to property declaration,
 * unlike Java where usually we put property at the top of the class and getter/setter at the bottom.
 * My favorite feature are property delegates that increase the ability to reuse the code.
 * We can initialize a variable when it is needed (lazy delegate),
 * perform some action whenever the property value is changed (observable delegate)
 * or simply store our property in another object (Android shared preferences, map, browser session, databaseâ€¦) using a custom delegate.
 */


// Good thing is that Kotlin allows us to use both functions (technically methods) and properties in the interfaces.

/**
 * There is also additional set of guidelines (coming from Effective Java If I remember correctly)
 * helping us to tell if property is preferred over function:
 * does not throw exception
 * is cheap to calculate (or cached on the first run)
 * returns the same result over multiple invocations
